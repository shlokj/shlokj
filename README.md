### Hi, Iâ€™m Shlok! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Having previously worked with robotics and embedded systems, Iâ€™m now enthusiastic about building mobile and web apps. I love to help solve problems in education and healthcare, from building a platform that helped thousands of underprivileged students gain access to textbooks for school to working with a startup aiming to bring hospital services to patientsâ€™ homes.

Iâ€™m always eager to keep learning new technologies, but for now, I prefer to work with
- React and React Native in the frontend
- Node.js with any SQL/NoSQL database in the backend (I'm proficient in GraphQL and MySQL)
- Java and Kotlin for native Android apps
- Cloud services: AWS and GCP/Firebase.

Iâ€™d love to chat! Feel free to [email me](mailto:shlokj@ucla.edu) or [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shlokj/)!
