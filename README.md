### Hi, Iâ€™m Shlok! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Having previously worked with robotics and embedded systems, Iâ€™m now enthusiastic about building cloud-based mobile and web apps. I love to help solve problems in education and healthcare, from building [a platform](https://booksyndy.in/) that helped thousands of underprivileged students gain access to school textbooks to working with [a startup](https://www.sprinterhealth.com/) aiming to bring hospital services to patientsâ€™ homes. Last summer, I interned at AWS, on the Industrial IoT and Edge team.

Iâ€™d love to chat: feel free to [email me](mailto:shlokj@ucla.edu) or [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shlokj/)!
